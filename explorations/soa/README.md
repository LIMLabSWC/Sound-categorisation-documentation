# Summary

* **001-BE model variations:** Looked at 3 different versions of BE model, their pshycometrics and updates after Hard/Easy trials. Decided to omit $\eta_{relax}$.

* **002-BE equivalent of SC:** Extracted BE equivalent boundary distribution of SC model, and realised it violates monotonic non-decreasing condition of CDF, so there's no BE equivalent for SC model.
